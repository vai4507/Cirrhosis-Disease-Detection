# Cirrhosis-Disease-Detection
This project applies machine learning classification algorithms to predict disease outcomes in patients with cirrhosis using clinical data. The workflow includes:

Data Exploration: Correlation analysis and heatmaps to understand feature relationships.

Preprocessing: Feature selection, train-test split, and standardization.

Modeling: Implemented multiple classifiers â€“

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Naive Bayes

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Evaluation: Compared models using confusion matrices, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Results are visualized with bar and line plots.

User Prediction: Allows user input of patient parameters (Age, Bilirubin, Albumin, etc.) to predict cirrhosis status.

ðŸ”¹ This project demonstrates the application of supervised learning techniques in medical data analysis and disease prediction, while comparing different algorithms for performance.
